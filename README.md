# Search file - hw05 - C
School project that works similarly to bash 'find', has several options that restrict/extend search

I am unable to provide the project requirements due to it being a school project. Therefore it has some specific features that may be redundant.

This C programme is based on bash 'find' function. It recursively searches the current or specified directory for file(s) that match the criteria
set by options. Basic criteria like file name, owner, mask, one can set how deep the recursion can go or from which point the search should start
and if the found files are sorted by their size or path.
If all criteria set by options are met and a file(s) is found it's path is returned.
